**S Single Responsibility Principle**</br>
A class or method should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility

**O Open Closed Principle**</br>
A software class or module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**L Liskov Substitution Principle**</br>
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program.
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

**I Interface Segregation Principle**</br>
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. 
It help in keeping interface focused and prevent them from becoming too large.

**D Dependency Inversion Principle**</br>
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depends on abstractions.
