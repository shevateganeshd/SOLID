SOLID Principles

S Single Responsibility Principle
O Open-Closed Principle
L Liskov Substitution Principle
I Interface Segregation Principle
D Dependency Inversion Principle

S Single Responsibility Principle
A class or method should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility

O Open Closed Principle
A software class or module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program.
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

I Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. 
It help in keeping interface focused and prevent them from becoming too large.

D Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depends on abstractions.
